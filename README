This directory contains materials related to using the binary-level
symbolic execution tool FuzzBALL to search for adaptors that show the
equivalence between binary code fragments. FuzzBALL itself is not
included; it is an open-source project available at:

https://github.com/bitblaze-fuzzball/fuzzball

We have not yet build a general-purpose tool: the "eg" directory
contains examples of applying FuzzBALL in this style to specific
examples.
