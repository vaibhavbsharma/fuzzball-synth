This directory contains materials related to using the binary-level
symbolic execution tool FuzzBALL to search for adaptors that show the
equivalence between binary code fragments. FuzzBALL itself is not
included in this directory; there is a suitable branched version of it
in

  ../../tools/fuzzball

and you can also see the public upstream version at

  https://github.com/bitblaze-fuzzball/fuzzball

We don't yet have a end-to-end automated tool: the "eg" directory
contains examples of applying FuzzBALL in this style to specific
examples.
