This directory contains scripts which build on top of FuzzBALL to
analyze the interface of a binary-code function, particularly which
registers or stack locations might contain arguments.

The "libc-proto" directory is our first prototype for experiments on
the GNU C library, which uses the simple approach of pattern matching
on the textual trace output that FuzzBALL already produces.
