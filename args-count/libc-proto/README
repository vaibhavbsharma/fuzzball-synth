To run this code, you should already have compiled FuzzBALL and STP
under the tools/fuzzball directory of the repository. In this
directory (perhaps via symlink or copying), "types.dat" should be a
file listing the library functions you want to investigate including
their ground-truth argument counts (for instance
../../eg/libc/types-gdb/clang-types.out), and "libc-2.19.so" should be
an x86-64 Linux binary of the GNU C library.

For code that operates on floating point, STP is not so suitable
because it does not support the theory of floating-point operators. If
you make a symlink in this directory named z3 and pointing to a recent
Z3 binary, the script will use it in preference to STP.
