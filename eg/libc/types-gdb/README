This directory currently has the results of an attempt to enumerate
the public functions in the Ubuntu 14.04 version of glibc 2.19, and
determine their types according to GDB. This was a partially-automated
approach where I enumerated function names from the output of "nm",
then checked which functions were documented and/or declared in header
files by trying to get that program to compile. Then I printed the
function types using GDB's "ptype" command with a script. "longjmp"
crashes before reaching the first line so I did it manually. The
results are types.out, containing 1400 functions. One disadvantage
clear from this technique is that it does not give useful types for
functions that are implemented in assembly language, like most syscall
wrappers. Also the types would still not be trivial to parse.
