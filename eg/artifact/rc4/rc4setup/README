These experiments correspond to 'RC4 key structure initialization' 
subsection of Section 4.4 of our ISSTA submission.

We synthesize argument substitution and memory substitution adaptors 
for the RC4 key structure initialization functions in OpenSSL and 
mbedTLS. The adaptors for the mbedTLS <- OpenSSL and OpenSSL <- mbedTLS 
directions are different. The target and inner function implementations 
can be found in f1 and f2 respectively, in each of the source files.

We describe adaptor synthesis in the two adaptor directions as follows.
Please note that these commands require LD_LIBRARY_PATH to have the path
to ../lib, for example, 
  LD_LIBRARY_PATH=`pwd`/../../lib/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

(1) The command to synthesize adaptors in the mbedTLS <- OpenSSL 
direction is: 
  perl synth-rc4-mo-setup.pl 1328 1329 1 1 -1 15 
This file uses the binary 'rc4setup_m_o', the corresponding source code 
for which is in rc4setup_m_o.c. This experiment completes in 60 to 65 
minutes.
We provide sample output in the file 'synth-rc4-mo-setup.log'. 
The last line of this output is: 
Final adaptors: arg=,,1,1,,1, ret=,, struct=f1_type=0x30000, f1_size=0x2, f1_n=0x4, f2_type=0x801070000, f2_size=0x4, f2_n=0x100,


The argument substitution adaptor is to be read as (0,0, 1,1, 0,1) and 
the return value adaptor as (0,0). This means the 1st argument to f2 
should be the 1st argument to f1, the 2nd argument to f2 should be 
the constant value 1, the 3rd argument to f2 should be the 2nd argument 
to f1. The return value adaptor (0,0) means that the return value 
should be returned as-is. 

The memory substitution adaptor is to be interpreted as : the 1st 8 
bytes of the inner structure (RC4_KEY) should be copied over from the 
1st 8 bytes in the target structure (mbedtls_arc4_context) as 2 4-byte 
entries with zero extension. Bytes from positions 8 to 1031 in the 
inner structure should be copied over from bytes 8 to 263 in the target 
structure as 256 4-byte entries with zero extension.

(2) The command to synthesize adaptors in the OpenSSL <- mbedTLS 
direction: 
  perl synth-rc4-om-setup.pl 1329 1328 1 1 -1 15
This file uses the binary 'rc4setup_o_m', the corresponding source code 
for which is in rc4setup_o_m.c. This experiment finishes in 50 to 55 
minutes.
We provide sample output in the file 'synth-rc4-om-setup.log'. 
The last line of this output is:
Final adaptors: arg=,,,2,1,, ret=,2, struct=f1_type=0x30000, f1_size=0x4, f1_n=0x2, f2_type=0x804070001, f2_size=0x1, f2_n=0x100.

This argument substitution adaptor is to be read as (0,0, 0,2, 1,0) and 
the return value adaptor as (0,2). This means that the 1st argument to 
f2 should be the 1st argument to f1, the 2nd argument to f2 should be 
the 3rd argument to f1, and the 3rd argument to f2 should be the 
constant value 0. This causes the keylen argument to be passed as 0 to 
f2 (see rc4setup_o_m.c) but it still allows the 1st entry in the key 
character array to be used. 

The return value adaptor (0,2) means that the return value should be 
replaced by the 3rd argument to f2, which is set to the constant value 
of 0 by the argument substitution adaptor. However, the function f2 
returns 0 anyway, so this return value adaptor, while being correct, 
does not affect f2's behavior. 

The memory substitution adaptor is to be interpreted as : the 1st 8 
bytes of the inner structure (mbedtls_arc4_context) should be copied 
over from the 1st 8 bytes in the target structure (RC4_KEY) as 2 4-byte 
entries with zero extension. Bytes from positions 8 to 263 in the inner 
structure should be copied over from bytes 8 to 1031 in the target 
structure as 256 1-byte entries.
