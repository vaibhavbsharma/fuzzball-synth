These experiments correspond to results reported in Section 4.4 of 
our ISSTA submission. 

These experiments involved using OpenSSL and mbedTLS.
We compiled OpenSSL from its github repository 
(https://github.com/openssl/openssl.git)
with the latest git commit id being b1837abd674f62a04f1191c68ca7e5c3101ce5a0.
For mbedTLS, we downloaded version 2.3.0 from its website
(https://tls.mbed.org/download).

We recommend understanding the output of the RC4 encryption experiments 
(rc4enc) first before proceeding to the RC4 key structure 
initialization functions (rc4setup).
