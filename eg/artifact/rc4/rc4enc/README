These experiments correspond to the 'RC4 encryption' subsection of Section 4.4 of our ISSTA submission.

We wrap around the RC4 encryption functions in mbedTLS and OpenSSL and expose only the RC4 key structures from our wrapper functions. The implementation of our target and inner functions can be found in f1 and f2.

The command for running this experiment in the mbedTLS <- OpenSSL direction is: perl synth-mo-enc.pl 1326 1327 1 1 -1 15
This script runs the binary 'rc4enc_mo', the corresponding source code for which can be found in 'rc4enc_mo.c'. We provide the output generated by this experiment in 'synth-mo-enc.log'. The last line in this output should be: 
Final adaptors: arg=,, ret=72,, struct=f1_type=0x70000, f1_size=0x2, f1_n=0x4, f2_type=0x801070000, f2_size=0x4, f2_n=0x100

The memory substitution adaptor is to be interpreted as : the 1st 8 bytes of the inner structure (mbedtls_arc4_context) should be copied over from the 1st 8 bytes in the target structure (RC4_KEY) as 2 4-byte entries with zero extension. Bytes from positions 8 to 1031 in the inner structure should be copied over from bytes 8 to 263 in the target structure as 256 4-byte entries with zero extension.

Command for om: perl synth-om-enc.pl 1327 1326 1 1 -1 15
