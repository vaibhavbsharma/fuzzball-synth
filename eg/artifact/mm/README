This experiment corresponds to Section 4.3 in our ISSTA submission.

We adapt an implementation of Strassen's algorithm for matrix multiplication to a naive implementation of matrix multiplication by making use of the argument substitution adaptor. 

The target function (f1) is the naive implementation and the inner function (f2) wraps around the implementation of Strassen's algorithm was taken from Intel (https://software.intel.com/en-us/courseware/256200).

Command to run this experiment: perl synth-mm.pl 1330 1331 1 1 -1 15
This experiment takes about 8 minutes to finish. We provide the output generated by this experiment in synth-mm.log.

The last line of this output is: Final adaptors: arg=,2,,,,1, ret=,, with 1,1,complete
This means that the 1st argument to f2 should be the 3rd argument to f1. The 2nd and 3rd arguments to f2 should be the 1st and 2nd arguments to f1 respectively.
