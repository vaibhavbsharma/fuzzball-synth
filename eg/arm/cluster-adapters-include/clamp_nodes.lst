one-sided-clamp

val%2 ? 0 : N
invert the low 1 bit of val

val%2 == 1 ? 0x80000000 : 0


low-bit(val1) && (val2 != 0)
extract sign bit of low byte of val
convert negative to negative + (1<<31)
sign-bit(low-16-bits(val)) == 0 ? 1 : 16-to-32S(val) (i think this is the same as a 16-bit-value < 0 comparison)


val < N ? N1 : N2
val > N ? N1 : N2
val == N ? N1 : N2
val != N ? N1 : N2
val == N1 || val == N2
val >= N

val == N
val != N
val > N
val < N:
val1 || val2
!val1 || val2
